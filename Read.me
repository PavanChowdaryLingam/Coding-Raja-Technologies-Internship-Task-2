# CODING RAJA TECHNOLOGIES!
## Artificial Intelligence Task 2: Object Detection and Tracking in Video

### Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform object detection and tracking in a video using artificial intelligence techniques. We utilize the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model for object detection and OpenCV for real-time video processing and tracking.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (opencv-python)
- NumPy

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Objectives

- **Object Detection**: Utilize YOLOv3 to detect various objects in each frame of a video feed.
- **Object Tracking**: Implement tracking of detected objects across video frames to monitor their movements.
- **Visualization**: Draw bounding boxes around detected objects and label them for visual identification.

### Project Structure

- **`object_detection_tracking.py`**: Python script for object detection and tracking.
- **`yolov3.weights`**: Pre-trained weights for the YOLOv3 model.
- **`yolov3.cfg`**: Configuration file for the YOLOv3 model.
- **`coco.names`**: List of class names used in the COCO dataset for object labeling.

### Usage

1. **Download Model Files**:
   - Obtain `yolov3.weights` and `yolov3.cfg` from the official YOLO website or repository.
   - Download `coco.names` which contains the list of COCO dataset classes.

2. **Setup**:
   - Place `yolov3.weights`, `yolov3.cfg`, and `coco.names` in the same directory as `object_detection_tracking.py`.

3. **Run**:
   ```bash
   python object_detection_tracking.py
   ```

4. **Instructions**:
   - Press `Q` to exit the video feed.
   - Adjust detection parameters (thresholds, NMS) inside `object_detection_tracking.py` as needed.
